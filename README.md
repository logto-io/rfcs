# Logto RFCs

Usually, there's no need to create a RFC for changes since they can be properly handled by the normal code review process. However, some changes may be considered as "RFC-worthy" if:

- They are big enough to require a discussion before implementation.
- They introduce a new feature or a new way of doing things rather than leveraging existing implementations or open standards.
- They affect the overall architecture of the project.

The judgement of whether a change is "RFC-worthy" is left to the discretion of the project maintainers.
